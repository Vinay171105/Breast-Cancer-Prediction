Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning:

This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on diagnostic features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
The goal is to build accurate, interpretable models that assist in early detection and diagnosis.

Features:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy

2. Model training using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest

3. Model evaluation using Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

4. Data visualization and feature correlation analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib

5. Comparison of algorithm performance to identify the most effective model

Algorithms Used:

1. Logistic Regression – Linear model for binary classification

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Distance-based classification

3. Random Forest – Ensemble-based decision tree classifier

Dataset:

=> The dataset used is the Breast Cancer(Diagnostic) Dataset, available via:

           sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()
